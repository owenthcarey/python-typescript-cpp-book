Would it be possible to use Pyodide to create a new client-side web framework in
Python thatâ€™s similar to Angular with class-based components?

---

Yes, it's possible to use Pyodide to create a new client-side web framework in
Python that's similar to Angular with class-based components. Let's break this
down:

1. Pyodide: Pyodide allows you to run Python in the browser. It compiles the
   Python interpreter to WebAssembly and provides a bridge to the JavaScript
   environment, which means you can interact with the DOM, access the web APIs,
   etc.
2. Creating a Web Framework: With Pyodide, you could create a Python-based web
   framework that provides an abstraction layer over the DOM, web APIs, etc.
   This would be similar to how Angular, React, and other frameworks provide a
   higher-level way to build web applications.
3. Class-based components: Python supports class-based programming, so it's
   possible to develop a component system similar to Angular's. Each component
   could be a Python class with its own lifecycle methods, input properties,
   etc.

Here are some steps you could consider:

1. Bootstrap Pyodide: First, you'd bootstrap Pyodide to load and run Python in
   the browser.
2. Abstraction over the DOM: You'd create Python classes or functions that
   abstract DOM interactions. For instance, instead of using JavaScript to
   update an element, you could have Python methods like update_element(),
   create_element(), etc.
3. Component Lifecycle: Define lifecycle hooks or methods similar to ngOnInit(),
   ngOnDestroy() in Angular. Each Python class that represents a component would
   use these hooks to manage its lifecycle.
4. Change Detection: This is one of the more complex parts. Angular uses a
   sophisticated change detection mechanism to update the view when the data
   changes. You'd need something similar to ensure the Python objects' changes
   are reflected in the actual DOM.
5. Event Handling: Allow Python methods to be used as event handlers. When an
   event is triggered in the DOM, it should call the associated Python method.
6. Tooling: One of the strengths of frameworks like Angular is the tooling
   around them. You'd probably want to create a CLI or other tools to help
   developers scaffold new projects, components, etc.
7. Integrate with JavaScript Libraries: While you're running Python, there will
   be times when you'll need to use existing JavaScript libraries. Ensure your
   framework has a seamless way to integrate with them.
8. Performance: This is a significant consideration. WebAssembly (and thus
   Pyodide) is fast, but interacting between JavaScript and WebAssembly has an
   overhead. You'd need to optimize and ensure that this overhead doesn't make
   the framework slow.
9. Documentation & Community: Like any new framework or tool, the documentation
   and community support play a crucial role in its adoption. Ensure you provide
   detailed documentation, tutorials, and foster a community around it.

It's an ambitious project but certainly doable. The outcome could be a Pythonic
way to build web applications, which could be a game-changer for developers more
comfortable with Python than JavaScript.

Can you help me get started?

---

Certainly! Let's start by setting up a basic architecture for our Python-based
web framework using Pyodide. I'll provide you with a basic blueprint and then a
simple example to get started.

1. Setting Up

Before you start, you'll need:

- A web server or local development environment to serve files (
  e.g., `http-server` or similar).
- Pyodide: You'll need to fetch Pyodide from its official source or CDN.

2. Bootstrap Pyodide

Create an `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Python Web Framework</title>
  <script type="text/javascript"
          src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.0/full/pyodide.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
  async function loadPython() {
    await loadPyodide({indexURL: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.0/full/"});
    pyodide.runPython(`
                print("Python is running in your browser!")
            `);
  }

  window.onload = loadPython;
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

When you open this page, it will initialize Pyodide and run a simple Python
print statement in the browser.

3. DOM Abstraction Layer

Let's make a simple DOM abstraction. Create a `framework.py`:

```python
from js import document


class Element:
    def __init__(self, tag):
        self.element = document.createElement(tag)

    def set_text(self, text):
        self.element.textContent = text

    def append_to(self, parent):
        parent.element.appendChild(self.element)


class BodyElement(Element):
    def __init__(self):
        self.element = document.body

# More abstraction as needed...
```

4. Sample Component

In the same `framework.py`:

```python
class BaseComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.render()

    def render(self):
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "render method should be implemented by subclasses")


class HelloWorldComponent(BaseComponent):
    def render(self):
        el = Element('h1')
        el.set_text('Hello, World!')
        el.append_to(BodyElement())
```

5. Integrate with Pyodide

Modify your `index.html`:

```javascript
async function loadPython() {
  await loadPyodide({indexURL: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.0/full/"});
  pyodide.loadPackage(['micropip']).then(() => {
    pyodide.runPython(`
            # Here, import your framework and run your component
            from framework import HelloWorldComponent
            HelloWorldComponent()
        `);
  });
}
```

Make sure your server serves `framework.py` so Pyodide can access it.

6. Further Steps

- Add more abstractions and utilities to `framework.py`.
- Implement event handling, change detection, and component life cycle methods.
- Build tooling and utilities to help develop applications using your framework.

Remember, building a full-fledged framework is a considerable task. The above
steps give you a basic idea and a starting point. From here, iterate,
experiment, and refine your design and architecture.

Amazing! How can I test this initial example? Should I just open
that `index.html` you created in a browser?

---

While you might be tempted to open `index.html` directly in a browser, doing so
might not work due to browser security restrictions. The JavaScript Fetch API (
which Pyodide uses to fetch packages and Python files) will often not work with
the `file://` protocol, resulting in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
issues.

Instead, you should serve the files using a web server. Here's how you can set
up a basic web server for development purposes:

## Using `http-server`

1. If you haven't installed `http-server`, you can do so using `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing your `index.html` and `framework.py`.
3. Start the server:

```bash
http-server
```

4. Once started, it should give you an address,
   typically `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. Open that in your web browser.

## Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server

If you have Python installed and prefer not to use Node.js and `http-server`,
Python provides a simple HTTP server out of the box.

1. Navigate to the directory containing your `index.html` and `framework.py`.
2. For Python 3.x, run:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

3. Just like with `http-server`, you can open the provided address in your
   browser, typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Whichever method you choose, once you navigate to the provided address in your
web browser, you should see Python initializing and then the message "Hello,
World!" displayed on the page. If you open the browser's console (usually by
pressing F12), you should also see the print statement "Python is running in
your browser!" indicating that Pyodide has successfully loaded and executed
Python code.
