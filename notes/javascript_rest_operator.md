Can you explain how three dots can be used in JavaScript to indicate that all
remaining function arguments should be collected into a single array?

---

Certainly! In JavaScript, the three dots `...` is called the "spread" or "rest"
operator, depending on the context in which it's used. When you're referring to
collecting all remaining function arguments into a single array, you're talking
about its "rest" usage.

Here's a brief explanation:

## Rest Parameters:

The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of
arguments as an array. This can be useful when we donâ€™t know the exact number of
arguments that will be passed to the function.

Example:

```javascript
function collectAllArgs(...args) {
  console.log(args);
}

collectAllArgs(1, 2, 3);    // [1, 2, 3]
collectAllArgs('a', 'b', 'c', 'd');    // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

In the `collectAllArgs` function, `args` will collect all passed arguments into
an array.

Here's another example with both regular and rest parameters:

```javascript
function greet(greeting, ...names) {
  for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}!`);
  }
}

greet("Hello", "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
// Outputs:
// Hello, Alice!
// Hello, Bob!
// Hello, Charlie!
```

Note:

1. The rest parameter must be the last parameter in the function.
2. There can be only one rest parameter in a function.

I hope that helps explain the concept! If you have any more questions, feel free
to ask.
